# API with Docker - README

This is the README for the API with Docker that you need to set up and run using the following commands:

## Initial Setup

1. Clone the API repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

## Steps to Run the API

1. Open a terminal in the root folder of the project.
2. Run the `docker-compose build` command to build the necessary Docker image.
3. After the image is successfully built, run `docker-compose up -d` to start the containers in the background.
4. Then, execute `docker-compose exec app composer install` to install Composer dependencies in the application container.
5. On the first run, you need to generate an application key. Run `docker-compose exec app php artisan key:generate` to generate the Laravel application key.

Now the API is ready to receive requests!

## API Requests

You can make the following requests to the API:

### Create a Short URL

**Endpoint:** POST `/api/v1/short-urls`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "url": "ORIGINAL_URL"
}
```

Replace `ORIGINAL_URL` with the original URL you want to shorten.

**Request Headers:**
```
Authorization: Bearer [YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN]
```

Replace `[YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN]` with the access token required for authentication.

**Successful Response:**
```json
{
  "url": "SHORTENED_URL"
}
```

Replace `SHORTENED_URL` with the shortened URL generated by the API.

**Response Status Codes:**
- 201: OK. The URL has been successfully shortened.
- 400: Bad Request. The request is incorrect or incomplete.
- 401: Unauthorized. Access token is missing or invalid.
- 500: Internal Server Error. An error has occurred on the server.

That's it! Now you can start using the API with Docker by following these steps, including the required authorization header, and making the necessary requests. If you encounter any issues, make sure to check your Docker configuration, the commands used, the authentication setup, and the expected response from the endpoint.
